# Cheil Coding Challenge _(Starbooks)_
## Prerequisites
This project will require a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) environment as well as [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

## Technologies Used
Major technologies:
- TypeScript
- Node/Express
- React.js
- Vite

Minor technologies:
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- axios
- nodemon

## Running the app

First run `yarn install`

You can run both the server and client at once by running:
`yarn start`

To run just the server do `yarn server`

To run only the client dev server run `yarn dev`

## Remaining Work

I chose to focus my efforts on what I thought are the most important parts of the challenge: scaffolding a scalable project and the "Just Landed" / "Departing Soon" sections of the UI.

I estimate the time to complete for the remaining tasks as following:

- Header and footer with animations and function scroll buttons (1-2 hrs)
- Making the entire layout responsive (2-5 hrs, depending on how granular you want to be)
- Making final adjustments to the css in order to acheive complete parity with the mockup (1-5 hrs)

Total effort remaining 4-12 hrs, depending on what level of detail you want to achieve.
